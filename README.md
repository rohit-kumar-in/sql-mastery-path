Welcome to my SQL learning repository! This project serves as a structured archive of my progress as I transition from a beginner to an expert in database management and data analysis.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* **/Basics**: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and basic arithmetic.
* **/Intermediate**: Joins (Inner, Left, Right), Aggregations (GROUP BY), and Subqueries.
* **/Projects**: Small database schemas I have designed from scratch.
* **/Resources**: Links to documentation and tutorials I found helpful.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite** (Mention which one you are using)
* **DBeaver / pgAdmin** (Your preferred GUI)

## 📈 Current Goals
- [ ] Master all Join types.
- [ ] Understand Window Functions.
- [ ] Complete 50+ LeetCode SQL challenges.
